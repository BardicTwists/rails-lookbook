## Development

Lookbook is implemented as an isolated [Rails Engine](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) and uses [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) for its UI.

This repository contains:

* The Lookbook source code ([`/app`](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook/tree/main/app), [`/lib`](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook/tree/main/lib), [`/config`](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook/tree/main/config), etc)
* The Lookbook [documentation site](#docs-site) source code and content ([`/docs`](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook/tree/main/docs)).
* A [test suite](#testing) with a 'runable' dummy app ([`/spec`](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook/tree/main/spec)).

### Documentation site

The [Lookbook docs site](https://lookbook.build) is built using [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) and the source files can be found in the `./docs` directory.

To preview changes locally you can run a development version of the docs site:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Start the app: `bin/docs`
4. Visit http://localhost:4000 

### Testing

Lookbook uses [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec) for testing.

Tests can be run using the `rake spec` or `bundle exec rspec` commands.

The dummy app that the tests are being run against can be viewed by running the `bin/dummy` command and then browsing to http://localhost:9292/lookbook
