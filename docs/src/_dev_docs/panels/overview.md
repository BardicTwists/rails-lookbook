  The Lookbook **preview inspector** is where each preview is rendered alongside its source code, notes and more.

  The inspector is made up of a number of tabbed panels, grouped into two areas - the preview area at the top (with **Preview** and **HTML** tabs)
  and the drawer area at the bottom (with **Source**, **Notes**, and **Params** tabs).

  It is possible to add custom tab panels into the drawer area, as well as to hide, reposition or reorder the system-provided panels.
