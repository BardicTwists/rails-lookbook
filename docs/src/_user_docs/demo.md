If you want to have a quick play with Lookbook, the easiest way is to [give the demo app](<%= links.v2.demo %>) a spin. It's a basic Rails/ViewComponent app with a few test components included to tinker with.

<%= link_list ["Lookbook Demo", links.v2.demo] %>

If you'd rather dig in a bit more and run the demo app locally, the [demo repo](<%= links.v2.demo_repo %>) contains instructions on how to get it up and running.
