## Tips for using Lookbook

### Keyboard shortcuts

Lookbook provides a few keyboard shortcuts to help you quickly move around the UI.

- `f` - move focus to the nav filter box
- `Esc` [when focus is in nav filter box] - Clear contents if text is present, or return focus to the UI if the box is already empty
- `s` - Switch to Source tab in the drawer
- `n` - Switch to Notes tab in the drawer
- `v` - Switch to the rendered preview
- `o` - Switch to the code preview
- `r` - Refresh the preview (useful if using something like Faker to generate randomised data for the preview)
- `w` - Open the standalone rendered preview in a new window
