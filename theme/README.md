## Lookbook Themes

ðŸš¨ **Do not edit the `theme.json` file in this directory directly!** It is regenerated automatically when the contents of the `config.js` file changes.

To add additional CSS variables to the theme or to make any other adjustments, make the changes and then run `npm run watch` or `npm run build` from the root directory to regenerate the theme files and rebuild the CSS.
